Parcels - Ruby
==================

March 10, 2014

Epicodus: Week4, Day1
First day with Ruby's object model

********************
Lesson:

Create a Parcel class.

You should be able to create a new parcel and specify the dimensions and weight in the arguments.

When you call volume on an instance, it should return the product of the sides.

When you call the cost_to_ship method on your die, return a cost based on a formula you make up.

Build a program that lets users calculate shipping costs.
